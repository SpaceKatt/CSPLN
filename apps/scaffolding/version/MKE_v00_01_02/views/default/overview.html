<h2>Overview of Peirce's "Logic Notebook" (MS 339)</h2>
<h3>
    Introducton to web application
</h3>
<p>This web application is a pilot project for an effort based on Peirce’s “Logic Notebook” (MS 339, in the Harvard archive of his manuscripts). Peirce first conceived his Pragmatism in the late nineteenth century [1873 (CP 6.490], as the method of thinking used by any “scientific intelligence,” in the process of learning by experience [CP 8.206].</p>

<p>The current web application can serve as a “pilot” for examining and identifying the challenges of creating effective digital infrastructure access to Peirce’s archive, estimated to number 100,000 pages — at least 40,000 of which (his most mature work) remains unpublished and barely studied.  This web application contains a manuscript is a sort of “diary” recording the advances of his work (from 1865-1909), which can be developed into a key tool for improving digital access to Peirce's MSS, especially in identifying those 40,000 pages of late work.  The LN is our only reliable guide to what Peirce was working on through the years (and we're very fortunate that he kept this "diary").  The LN tool can even help in correcting the only catalogue (or finding aid) for the archive.

    Introduction to the Logic Notebook Testbed
</h3>
<p>
    We plan to evolve a "rapid-prototyping testbed," to exemplify C.S. Peirce’s pragmatic methodology.  Our Testbed pilot project for this effort will be based on Peirce’s “Logic Notebook” (MS 339, in the Harvard archive of his manuscripts). Our purpose is to investigate and demonstrate the potential of Peirce's theory and method to model effective testbed operation, which is fundamental to successful distributed scientific investigation.

    Testbeds were originally conceived (in 1989) as the method for “collaboratory” operation, where the advancement of coordination technologies requires applications in experimental versions. Testbeds operate in actual working contexts, where the appropriate components of systems architecture and the array of tools for data access and communication can be designed, developed, and tested within a program of prototyping, testing, and evaluation to support continuous development. In testbeds, participants have the opportunity to engage in creating tools for better ways of doing things by refining and validating both the tools that are supposed to augment their work and their own habits of behavior—in an interactive mode which makes possible purposeful, collaborative development, giving those for whom tools are created more critical control in that process of creation.  Testbeds can generally be considered observational contexts for continuous technology advancement, where technological products become more like services, directed by what W. Edwards Demming explained as "continuous quality improvement" [13].  Unfortunately, the ideal of testbed operation is not often realized, according to those who have been closely involved in their development, such as Bruce Schatz [14].
</p>
<p>
    1989 NSF collaboratory workshop report recommended a three-fold research agenda that would repeat itself in cycles of design, implementation and testing to evolve a Collaboratory of increasing value to science and to the nation. The first direction concerns system architecture and integration and would examine ways to allow people and machines to use the Collaboratory’s component technologies most effectively.  The second would evolve the tools and technologies themselves.  The third would develop user-oriented testbeds to validate both the technology and organization."
</p>
<p>
    Although such large-scale science advancements as human genome mapping and global warming research could not have progressed without the collaboratory, this mode of supporting scientific advancement has frequently failed to live up to expectations.  Analysts have recognized the need for better theories about how cooperation and coordination occur, and can improve with collaboration technology augmentation.  Results of analysis in the 1993 National Research Council report on the National Collaboratories indicate that although technology will never cause the unwilling to collaborate, it can facilitate collaboration among those who are motivated, which can then provide incentive to others. [5: 1-2].  We propose to apply Peirce's theory and method in examination of the challenges, to investigate what conditions are necessary for effective testbed operation in the context of creating digital access to Peirce’s currently inaccessible manuscripts, archived at Harvard.  
</p>
<p>
    Our Logic Notebook project will develop a model testbed for making critical decisions about how to evolve the transcription and other manuscript access processes (along with the tools required for these) toward a virtual research and development community, for continuing improvement of tools and the collaborative reasoning they are be designed to support.  As a founder of relational logic, who forecast the development of computing machines, our model would demonstrate how Peirce would now—and in the future—hope his ideas could be effectively represented, using media that can evolve in virtual communities of "testbed partnerships" between scholars and tool developers.  First, we need to understand the testbed method in terms of Peirce’s pragmatism.
</p>
<p>
    Peirce's theoretical view of knowledge representation (in terms of sign theory, or “semiotic”) conceives knowing as the provisional result of continuing hypothetical inference, in which meaning is virtual rather than factual.  Any conventional system we create tends to become algorithmic in our habitual application of it, allowing us to believe we can do only what that system can do (see Landauer and Grudin).  Peirce's pragmatic method, implied by his sign theory, reminds us to maintain a provisional view of our conventions by self-critically examining the actual and possible outcomes of our habitual behavior, using whatever means we can create to do so: observational instruments, modes of expressing and comparing results of these observations, and augmentation of these techniques and powers through the invention of communication media for that purpose.  
</p>
<p>
    Human-computer interaction provides an explicit opportunity to examine these semiotically conceived circumstances, to which Peirce's pragmatism responds as a guide for conducting research and development (see Keeler, 1995 and 1996).  The efficiency of intelligent experience (or learning) in establishing reliable habits (or conduct) depends on our capability to compare past results and postulate future outcomes (possible causes and effects), through communication (with oneself and others).  Learning, or gaining knowledge intelligently is more efficient than by simple trial-and-error—to the extent that we have the capability to represent and examine our experience in terms of what we can discern to be the "state of things" with respect to our experience, as it progresses.  Peirce created his Existential Graphs to make that process as representationally efficient as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Ideas in a particular field or group will continue to develop in this pragmatic fashion, depending on how well the communication procedure works for validating individual interpretive contributions.  But Peirce's pragmatism insists that we balance this "objective idealism" with "critical realism"—never forgetting that the "valid judgment" established by any group of inquirers is never final and infallible with respect to the evidence.  We must maintain effective access to the "primary data of experience" if we want our valid judgments also to tend toward reliability —that is, be meaningful in the long run (by reference, not merely by dogmatic authority or public opinion).  Pragmatism says: truth is what would be the result of indefinite inquiry.  Our way of proceeding—our method of inquiry—must entail checking the veracity of our representations with respect to what we intend them to refer (validity entails reliability).  In Peirce's terms, logic must be conceived in terms of sign theory. Our ultimate concern is not just to establish consensus that would simply resolve diverse opinions, but to reach consensus about interpretations that could then continue to be tested and modified in further, concerted experience of the (always hypothetical) existential conditions.  "There would not be any such thing as truth unless there were something which is as it is independently of how we may think it to be" (MS 881; CP 7.659 [1903]).
</p>
<p>
    [Starting from Basics?: when users try some software (such as for transcription), and it doesn't quite do what they (or we) need, then we must be able to alter the software (even change the system entirely, if we find a serious deficiency).  We've already found deficiencies in every available crowdsourcing system, when considering the testbed "dimension" of improvement to meet our needs (which we can continue to identify better, in the testbed context).  We must to be able to identify any problems in detail enough to know what to try in technological responses to them.]

<h4>
    Summary
</h4>
<p>
     The model of successful collaboratory operation in the sciences suggests that the "testbed" method could help stabilize and support an "evolving vision" of the digital resources of the future, by providing a virtual context where examination, conceptualization, development, and evaluation can take place much more effectively than under current conditions of information system advancement.  Resource tool developers need to share and compare methods and techniques in constructing resources based on content-specific requirements and use-related criteria that must be specified in actual contexts of operation (research and learning).  Resource users as well as developers need to compare prototype applications—evaluating the factors (such as image resolution, color quality, sound fidelity, text encoding, ease and speed of access, ease of resource sharing and system modification), considering requirements to suit particular research and learning purposes.  To accomplish such content and system development, digital resource developers need the same functionality that has been identified for the large, international science collaboratories, in order to share instruments and data remotely, to work together in cost-effective ways to create resources that can respond to the nature of any particular resource material, and the requirements of its users.  Collaboration is required so that ultimately these resources will be interlinkable at a conceptual level.

    Finholt: It is important to consider whether the relatively modest size and growth of collaboratories, compared to systems like the PDB reflects a failure of the original collaboratory vision.  Rather than failure, the experience with collaboratories to date indicates the enormous difficulties of supporting complex group work in virtual settings.  Overcoming these difficulties represents the great challenge for the next stage of collaboratory development and use.  Meeting this challenge involves both extracting lessons learned from previous collaboratory efforts and solving a number of critical problems at the tricky intersection of technology with individual and group behavior.

    “[According to the logical doctrine of Pragmatism] … the true meaning of any product of the intellect lies in whatever unitary determination it would impart to practical conduct under any and every conceivable circumstance, supposing such conduct to be guided by reflexion carried to an ultimate limit. It appears to have been virtually the philosophy of Socrates. But although it is "an old way of thinking," in the sense that it was practiced by Spinoza, Berkeley, and Kant, I am not aware of its having been definitely formulated, whether as a maxim of logical analysis or otherwise, by anybody before my publication of it in 1878. Naturally, nobody ever heard of pragmatism. People don't care for methods—they want results!” [6.490 (c. 1910)

    Lederberg and Uncapher explain, "Historically, many new technologies have been left dangling at the end of the research cycle waiting to be adopted by some user community or integrated into commercial products.  Since the potential users have had little experience with such technologies, they have little basis for asking for those tools" [3: 14].
